# Forest fires influence analysis

It is project, where I anlyse influence of forest fires in Amazonia this year(2019). Here you can find whole data processing pipeline, including data mining, integrating, clearing, reducing, handling missing data and outliers. After all data preparation I was using ARIMA model to predict weather for 2019 year and compare prediction with real weather measures.

## Getting started

Here you can find .ipynb files with all data preparation process and analysis. Actually, you don't need to clone this repository to see preparation and analysis, but if you want to run it locally, here are instructions:

#### Requirements
